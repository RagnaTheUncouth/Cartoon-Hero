        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <img src="img/bodyshot.jpg" id="fullBody">
        <p>Tall, handsome, & broad shouldered, Wolfwood is a man with tanned skin and black hair. His eye color varies from dark blue to gray depending on the iteration of the <a href="https://trigun.fandom.com/wiki/Trigun_(manga)" target="_blank" title="Trigun">Trigun</a> series. Typically wearing a simple black suit with a button-down shirt that's unbuttoned at the collar partly revealing his chest. He is rarely seen without smoking a cigarette.</p>

        <h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
        <p>A wandering priest. On first impressions, Wolfwood is someone who is relatively down-to-earth and almost eccentric. This lackadaisical front belies a pragmatic and stoic dispostion. He is a realist, and fairly into philosophy - and by extension religion although not excessively devout. Wolfwood tends to accept reality as it is, not having to rely on blind optimism to challenge the cruelty of mankind. He is plenty outspoken when the situation demands confrontation. Wolfwood is completely contradictory: a priest who kills and a man forced into evil without wanting to. His morals come into conflict when he meets <a href="https://trigun.fandom.com/wiki/Vash_the_Stampede" target="_blank" title="Vash the Stampede">Vash</a>. He starts to feel like a demon by seeing Vash following his pacifist ideals. However, Wolfwood is not just a cold-blooded killer. He does anything he can to protect the people he cares about, and never kills without the risk of dying.</p>

        <h3>Abilities</h3>
        <img src="img/punisher.jpg" id="weapon">
        <p>Wolfwood is one of the best gunmen in No Man's Land. He wields the Punisher, a cross that is both machine gun and rocket launcher. It can act as a shield and houses several handguns on one of its arms. Between being an excellent gunman, Wolfwood has automated healing, divine sensory abilities, and advanced muscle mass all thanks to the experiments performed on him by the <a href="https://trigun.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Michael" target="_blank" title="Eye of Michael">Eye of Michael</a>. The only downfall of all these abilities is he ages faster than a normal person.</p>

        <h3 id="trivia">Trivia</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>According to the series, the initial "D" in Wolfwood's name stands for "dangerous".</li>
            <li>The Punisher weighs a "hundred-and-so" kilograms. To manage this weapon, Wolfwood is claimed to have an "incredible sense of balance".</li>
            <li>Wolfwood's arsenal (like Vash) is represented by the title of the series with his Cross Punisher having three functions: a machine gun, a rocket launcher, and a compartment holding an array of handguns.</li>
